# DressExposure

Use tweet info to investigate perception of #TheDress

Investigate if ambient light levels and recent exposure to daylight affects the % of people seeing a white and gold dress. Use timings and locations of tweets to place mentions of #TheDress wrt light levels.

(Compare % in countries with different lengths of daytime? Difficult finding english-speaking countries (consistent word search) with vastly different daytime lengths and sufficient number of mentions of #TheDress.)


1) Collect tweets containing #TheDress, sorted by time. Specify location (UK) so that  sunrise and sunset times are consistent. Use status ids from Fri 27th Feb to search by time in windows of 1 hour.

2) Search collected tweets for mentions of “blue”, “black”, “white”, “gold”, “#blueandblack”, “#whiteandgold”.

Challenge 1 - understanding the meaning of the collected tweets. e.g. a mention of #blueandblack doesn’t necessarily indicate the user saw #blueandblack

Challenge 2 - user’s activity that day unknown. Routines and time spent outside at time of tweet will vary…
